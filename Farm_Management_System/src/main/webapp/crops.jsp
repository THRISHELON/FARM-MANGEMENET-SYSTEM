						<p class="fw-bold fs-5">Rice</p>
						<p>Rice is the most important Kharif crop of India. It is grown in rain-fed areas with hot and humid climates. Rice requires a temperature of 16-20 °C during the growing season and 18-32 °C during ripening. It needs rainfall from 150-200 cm. Urea has been one of the most important chemical Fertilizers for the crops and has been one of the instrumental factors in the increase in food grain production of the country.

						<p class="fw-bold fs-5">Cotton</p>
						<p>Cotton is a Kharif crop that requires approximately 8 months to cultivate. Black soil has excellent water retaining property which enables cotton to grow even in the regions which do not receive enough rainfall. Also the texture of black soil and high humus content favours cotton as well. Fertilizer for cotton:N-P-K 20-10-10 fertilizer is more suitable</p>
